### Key Projects 🚀  
Here are some of my recent projects showcasing what I’ve learned:  
- **[FlyNow ✈️](https://github.com/Erewhon-proj/Hackatania-FlyNow)**:  
  FlyNow is innovative software powered by OpenAI's cutting-edge AI technology.  
  Designed for travelers tired of wasting time searching for the cheapest flights across multiple destinations, FlyNow streamlines the process and has you covered!  

- **[IADataQuery 📊🤖](https://github.com/saintslisi/AIDataQuery)**:  
  Developed a system using OpenAI APIs to interact with a generic MySQL database. The project allows users to input requests in natural language, which are processed by a GPT model to automatically generate the appropriate SQL queries. The database results are then restructured and presented in a comprehensible format by the LLM.  

- **[Recipe Radar](#)**:  
  A Telegram bot that searches for recipes in a database based on the ingredients you have available.
